# How to run `tenet`

## Frontend

Before running the frontend, you need to install all dependencies via npm.

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the following command to start the frontend.


```bash
npm run dev
```

In default, the frontend will be running on `http://localhost:3000`. The window will be shown up automatically. If not, you can open the window manually.

Note that all APIs are mocked by default.
